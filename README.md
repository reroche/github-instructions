# Project 4: Github Instructions

The HTML version of the book is in the `docs` directory.

Click [here](https://reroche.github.io/github-instructions/) to see it in the browser!

Or go to `https://reroche.github.io/github-instructions/`.

The `book` directory contains the markdown files. It also has other configuration files if you feel like tweaking anything. Ask Elias if you have questions about how to use the files. If you have `R` installed, the `build` executable will compile the guide.

- **Elias**: `01.Rmd` -- Setting up Git repositories

- **Kylee**: `02.Rmd` -- Making changes

- **Xiong-Fei**: `03.Rmd` -- Tools for working locally

- **Cyrus**: `04.Rmd` -- Syncing your local files with github
