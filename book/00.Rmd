## Workflow {-}

To get a better idea of how this process might work in its use cases, consider the following series of events that is commonly used with this tool.

Two users want to create a repository, work on some of the files individually, and combine their changes for the final product. 


(1) One of the users calls `git init` to create the repository.

(2) User 1 calls `git clone` to copy the created remote repository so that they can work on their local computer.

(3) User 2 also calls `git clone` to copy the created remote repository locally.

(4) User 1 starts the progress by adding some files to the repository.

(5) User 1 calls `git add` to add these new files to the staging area so that git knows which files should be saved.

(6) User 1 calls `git commit` to save the changes in the staging area into a commit.

(7) User 1 calls `git push` to upload their changes from their local computer to the remote repository so both users can see the changes.

(8) User 2 calls `git pull` to download the changes made from the remote repository to their local computer and works on the latest version of the repository.

(9) User 2 edits some of the files and creates their own files.

(10) User 2 calls `git add` to include these files in the staging area.

(11) User 2 calls `git commit` to save the changes locally into a commit.

(12) User 2 calls `git push` to upload their changes to the remote repository for both users to see.
